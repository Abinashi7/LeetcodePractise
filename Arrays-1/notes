LECTURE-10 ARRAYS

1.	Diagonal Traverse #498 medium
a.	Tn = m*n
b.	Sc = constant
2.	Spiral matrix #54 medium
a.	Tn = m*n
b.	Sc = constant
3.	Product of array except itself
a.	// This is a two-pass algorithm where we calculate the running sum each time.
b.	    // In the first pass we calculate the running sum from left to right
c.	    // In the first pass we calculate the running sum from right to left
d.	    // Tc = O(n + n) = O(n)
e.	    // Sc= O(1) since we are returning the array as an answer

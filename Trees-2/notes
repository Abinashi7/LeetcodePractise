Traversals

Inorder:  only the root element matters in the center position 
-	Left -> root -> right
-	right-> root -> Left

post order: Left -> right -> root

pre order:  root -> left -> right


Question 2: Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

tn = O(h*n^2)
sc = O(h*n)

WHAT IS BACKTRACKING? 
-	To undo the last decision made. Or whatever action I have take I can reverse or undo it. 

HOW TO WRITE BACKTRACKING?
1.	Action
2.	Recurse
3.	Backtrack

HOW IS BACKTRACKING DIFFERENT FROM RECURSION? 
-	In recursion and backtracking we explore all the paths. Backtracking is efficient when you need to maintain non primitive type of a Data Structure (not a generalized statement).
